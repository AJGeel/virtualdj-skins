# VirtualDJ Skins

A git repository for version management of my custom VirtualDJ skins.

The `Super Pro` theme is based on the `Pro` theme. But as the name suggests, it's super pro.

To use it, select the skin in `Settings` > `Main Interface` > `Super_Pro`

## To do's:

- [x] Customize font, change sizing
- [ ] Customize icons
- [ ] Prevent font horizontal shrinking when overflowing. Prefer truncating instead.
- [ ] Add screenshot
- [ ] Learn how to DJ ðŸ˜­
